**Introduction to the Visual Material**
::
The following images are a series of visualizations created to explore the conceptual shift in perceiving a rock as either a soulless or soulful entity. Stemming from our conversation on how a simple object—a stone—can be interpreted differently depending on relational, spiritual, or philosophical frameworks, these images serve as an experimental tool for reflecting on the object's character, agency, and presence.

Each image attempts to visually capture what changes in a rock's appearance and atmosphere when it is imagined to possess or lack a soul. These depictions do not rely on material transformation alone but also explore subtle cues such as aura, texture, form, and light—elements often used metaphorically to express liveliness, relationality, or inertness.

The soulful rock is shown as vibrant, expressive, even subtly communicative. Its surface might seem animated, its form more open or embracing, evoking the sense of a presence or history beyond its physical boundaries. In contrast, the soulless rock appears closed off, mute, and resistant to engagement—a pure object, isolated from narrative, feeling, or ethics.

These contrasting visualizations support a broader inquiry into the ontological status of objects in both artistic and anthropological research. They ask: How do we project meaning or interiority onto matter? What criteria do we use—emotionally, culturally, or intellectually—to recognize presence or absence of soul? And what does this say about the way we relate to the more-than-human world?

In this research, the rock becomes more than geological matter—it becomes a site of projection, relation, and inquiry. The images aim not to resolve but to sensitize: to draw the viewer into a space where they might question their assumptions about life, liveliness, and the borders between object and being.
