**Introduction**

This project presents a collection of dialogues between myself and an artificial intelligence, each centered around the description and interpretation of a specific object. In every exchange, the AI is asked to articulate two perspectives:

1. An **analytical description** based on form, function, and structure
2. A **soulful interpretation** aimed at evoking the emotional, symbolic, or experiential dimensions of the object

In addition, the AI is prompted to consider how a spectator might perceive the object and what characteristics emerge through that act of looking.

**Research Focus**

The core of this research lies in an exploration of how the material world is made legible—how it is described, categorized, and brought into meaning. I investigate two interrelated themes:

* The **materialization and rationalization of the world** through dominant Western epistemologies, particularly scientific and dogmatic frameworks that promote singular, objective understandings of reality
* The potential for **alternative modes of perception** that recognize the multiplicity of existences and embrace the ambiguity, subjectivity, and relationality of being

This dual lens allows for a critical engagement with how we perceive, describe, and relate to objects—and, by extension, to the world itself.

**Why Artificial Intelligence?**

Artificial intelligence is commonly viewed as a tool of rational calculation: soulless, emotionless, and uncreative. By choosing to collaborate with an AI in this project, I aim to challenge this perception. Can something designed to analyze also participate in evoking feeling? Can a machine engage in dialogue that touches on presence, intuition, or soul?

The use of AI becomes a deliberate provocation—a way to test the boundaries of language, authorship, and perception. It raises questions about how we assign meaning and agency, and whether a tool typically seen as purely functional can contribute to more poetic or nuanced ways of seeing.

**Purpose**

Rather than aiming for definitive answers, this project creates a space for reflection. It is a space where contradictions can coexist, where the boundaries between analytical and affective, human and non-human, rational and intuitive are blurred. Through these dialogues, I seek to explore the role of description as a practice—not only of representation, but of world-making.
